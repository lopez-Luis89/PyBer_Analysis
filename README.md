## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.


From the data available from Pyber we were able to utilize it to further investigate the data set using locations, fare charges, number of trips and number of drivers available. As an Example we were able to calculate the average  fare rate per type of location (Urban, rural and Suburban), not only that but the average fare rate on average for each trip and driver. We were also able to visualize trends in an interval of time to compare all three tyoe of locations.



****Built DF for the analysis of the data
*** Built graph for visualization of the trends in a specific time frame

## Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
Deliverable 3 Requirements

1.) increase available drivers but maintain charge on fare to have higher sales
2.) Reduce Drivers on Urban Area to potentially have higher average fares
3.) Mofify fare rate(higher) for urban and suburban cities  during April and May to avoid agressive dips on fare
